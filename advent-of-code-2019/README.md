# Advent of Code 2019
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) is a super-geek Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that has become a personal Christmas tradition in the last three years. Here are my solutions (or solution attempts) to the puzzles.

Each folder in the repository contains the puzzle solutions for a single day and  corresponding input data. The two puzzles given each day are solved in two separate files.  

### Run the solutions
All solutions are given in JavaScript and it can be executed in a node.js environment.
